#### Near Vision:
You’ve been managing product data with disparate systems for quite some time, and your series of spreadsheets and homegrown databases have worked up to this point. But over time, this approach becomes unwieldy, especially as your external channels multiply. PIM is a scalable infrastructure that can save your organization time, reduce errors in data, and improve your overall customer experience.

#### Far Vision:
You can easily manage your branches or other stores in different countries which may have different product catalog, manufacturers, tax etc.
Multiple user roles due to multiple stores. Each store manager has its own identity in system so he can manage his own store.


# Stackholders:

#### Business Managers and Business Architects;
Business Analysts make predictions to understand the budget and the time that should be spent on the project. They work on detailed requirements and create project decomposition.

#### Project Sponsers
Project Sponsors are people that have an interest primarily in the success of the project rather than in its development process. They are usually called external stakeholders. 

#### Account and Sales Managers

#### End Users
Our target audience is business owners who want to manage their stores online (just like Shopify).
Your target audience is an essential link to the success of your project. That is why it is useful to engage end users in testing MVP or product beta-version to receive the initial feedback. Users’ feedback allows reviewing the work done and improve user experience.

#### Data Architects and Database Administrators
